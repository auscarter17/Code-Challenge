# Code Quiz

This is quiz that users can take to test their knowledge of basic web dev concepts. The quiz is multiple choice, and is timed. Your scores are saved and displayed when you complete the quiz or the timer has reached 0. 

## How to play
Upon opening the page, you will be greeted with a starting screen that gives an overview of the rules of the quiz. There is a "Begin Quiz" button at the bottom that will start the quiz when you are ready.

## Scoring System
* The score is calculated based upon how many correct answers you have, as well as the time remaining when you finish. 
* Each correct answer in the quiz is worth 10 points to your final score.
* If you finish the quiz, each second remaining on the clock will be worth 1 point towards your final score. 
* Every incorrect answer deducts 10 seconds from the clock. 
* At the end of the quiz (time out or finish), you will be shown your final score, and will be prompted to enter your initials for the scoreboard. 

## Quiz Functionality
As each question appears, you will be given three possible solutions. Choose the correct answer of the ones available. As you mouse over each answer, it will highlight to indicate you are about to select the answer that you intended. After you select your answer, an alert will appear letting you know whether you've answered correctly, or answered incorrectly and suffered a penalty.
